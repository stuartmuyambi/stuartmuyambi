# Hey! I'm Stuart üëãüèø

I'm a software enthusiast diving deep into full-stack JavaScript web technologies. I love creating and sharing useful technical content, mostly about computer science and web development.

During my university days, I built an online voting system and a hospital management system using vanilla PHP. Now, I'm focusing on learning JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB, with a keen interest in adding a touch of AI to my projects.

I also enjoy building open-source projects. Show some ‚ù§Ô∏è by reviewing my pull requests, contributing to my repositories, or leaving a ‚≠ê if you like a project!

When my contribution graph is blank, it probably means I was on vacation, working with a client, or engaged in an internal project. Life is short; enjoy it!
