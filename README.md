# Hey! I'm Stuart 👋🏿

I'm a software engineer mainly focusing on full-stack JavaScript web technologies. I love to create and share useful technical content mostly about computer science and web development but I also talk about other useful insights, tips and resources to help you get started and keep going in tech.

I also speak at some meetups, conferences and build useful open-source projects. Show some ❤️ by reviewing my pull requests, contributing to some of my open-source repositories or even leaving a ⭐ if you like a project!

Where my contribution graph is blank, it's probably because I was caring for my family or lifting weights. (Or perhaps I was working with a client or project in some internal capacity.) Life is short. Enjoy it!
