# Hey! I'm Stuart 👋🏿

I'm a Software Engineer specializing in JavaScript full-stack technologies. I create technical content mostly about Web Development and JavaScript, but I also talk about other topics. I also speak at some meetups/conferences and build useful open-source projects. Show some ❤️ by reviewing my pull requests, contributing to some of my open-source repositories or even leaving a ⭐ if you like a project!
