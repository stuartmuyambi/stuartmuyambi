# Hey! I'm Stuart 👋🏿

I'm a software enthusiast diving deep into full-stack JavaScript web technologies. I love creating and sharing useful technical content, mostly about web development, Accesibility and Performance.

Now, I'm focusing on learning JavaScript with a keen interest in adding a touch of AI to my projects.

I also enjoy building open-source projects. Show some ❤️ by reviewing my pull requests, contributing to my repositories, or leaving a ⭐ if you like a project!

When my contribution graph is blank, it probably means I was on vacation, working with a client, or engaged in an internal project. Life is short; enjoy it!
