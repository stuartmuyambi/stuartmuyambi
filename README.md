#  Hey, I'm Stuart  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I'm an outcome-oriented Software Developer and Technical Writer that loves to create and share useful content about computer science & the web. I create technical content (on [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@stuartcodes) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/stuartmuyambi)), build useful open-source projects, speak at some meetups/conferences and build technical communities.
