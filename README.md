# Hey! I'm Stuart 👋🏿

I'm a software engineer mainly focusing on full-stack JavaScript web technologies. I love to create and share useful technical content mostly about computer science and web development.

I also build useful open-source projects. Show some ❤️ by reviewing my pull requests, contributing to some of my open-source repositories or even leaving a ⭐ if you like a project!

Where my contribution graph is blank, it's probably because I was on vacation or perhaps I was working with a client or project in some internal capacity Life is short. Enjoy it!
